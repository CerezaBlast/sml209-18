This page aims to prepare the user for a visit to Spain with important words and phrases, with a writing style that reads similary to "If you were to meet a famous person, you could say this."

All phrases will include a simplified version of IPA as shown on the first website in the sources list below to guide the user on speaking. Additionally, recordings will be made for each phrase for the user to click on, which will either be computer generated or self recorded and embedded.

Finally, a H5P Dialogue Cards activity will appear to supplement this, and a H5P Single Choice set will appear on another page (with use of HTML) to test the learner on what they have learned.
