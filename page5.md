This part of the website aims to teach the learner basic verb conjugation rules, grammar to note (such as how to create questions and how to form the simple future) and irregular verbs to note. Additionally, there will be an introduction to formal and informal register.

This page will use HTML tables to clearly display verb conjugations, and will mostly be dependent on visual learning, using H5P activities such as Fill In The Blanks or Drag The Word to affirm the rules learned on the page. The text of the site will, again, read as if the reader is attempting to meet a famous person and wants to tell them about their future aspirations or ask how they're doing, with hope to increase user engagement.

Phrases on the page will include the same simplified IPA and audio files as the previous website, and will use the corresponding sources.

There will be a link to further reading, such as the sources.
