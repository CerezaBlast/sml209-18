With the famous person motif maintained, the final page will attempt to emulate conversations with famous people based on previous learning on pages. Images will be used with text and the H5P Column activity will be the majority of the page, combining most of the activities of the H5P website to combine word dragging, box filling, questionnaires, and Image Hotspotting to conclude the learning of the website, challenging the user to identify verb conjugations, famous people, cultural facts such as geography or famous Spaniards, and every day phrases.

Lastly, the H5P Summary activity will be used as a final test on a separate page, found by a HTML tag at the bottom of the page, to a learner's ability, and further reading and activities will be introduced. A suitable picture of Dora the Explorer will be shown because it's objectively cute.
